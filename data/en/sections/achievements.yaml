    Cerner Masters: Awarded to the top 1% each year, I earned this through being highly effective across many teams helping them scaffold new applications and services using our best practices and being our deployments expert.
    19 You Rock Peer Recognitions: An internal recognition award where teammates can nominate someone each quarter. Over the years I've received multiple of them because I enjoy helping others and would constantly answer questions and help people in our team chats.

  summary: |
    I love teaching and mentoring others. As a kid I ran a Library program teaching kids and adults Origami.
    At Cerner I participated in the DevCenter Mentorship program mentoring new hires through learning professional development process around code quality, code reviews, and feedback.
    Was a team lead with 5 direct reports helping them grow technically and professionally.
    I run 1-1's with individuals across teams that don't report to me to help them grow across multiple facets of their career at Cerner.
